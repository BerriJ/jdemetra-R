# jdemetra-R

This repository provides R files that simplify the use of JDemetra+ from R.
The current solution uses the R-package "rJava".

For running the exemples ("jd_test.R"), the user have still to install in a sub-folder "./Java" the right package of JDemetra+
(currently demetra-tstoolkit)2.0.0.jar; see also the "jd_init.R" file)
